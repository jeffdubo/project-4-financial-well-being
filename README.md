## Project Overview
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) conducted an online survey in 2017 to measure the financial well-being survey of adults in the United States. The survey included the CFPB Financial Well-Being Scale as well various measures that are believed to influence an individual's level of financial well-being. The goal of this project is to determine if and which of these measures can predict an individual's well-being.
